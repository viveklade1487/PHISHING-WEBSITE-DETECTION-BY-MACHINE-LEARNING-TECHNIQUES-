With the escalating threat of phishing attacks targeting unsuspecting online 
users, this project endeavors to fortify cybersecurity defenses through the 
application of machine learning models and deep neural networks. The primary 
objective is to predict and preemptively identify phishing websites by 
extracting pertinent features from a diverse dataset encompassing both 
legitimate and phishing URLs. Sourced from reputable repositories such as the 
University of New Brunswick and PhishTank, the dataset undergoes meticulous 
preprocessing, and a strategic selection of features is performed. Address Bar, 
Domain, and HTML & Javascript-based features are chosen for their inherent 
relevance to phishing attributes.
The supervised machine learning models employed in this study include 
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multilayer Perceptrons, XGBoost, and an 
Autoencoder Neural Network. These models are trained on the feature-rich 
dataset, and their performance is rigorously evaluated, with a focus on 
accuracy as the primary metric. Through this evaluation, a comparative analysis 
of the models' effectiveness is conducted, culminating in the identification of 
XGBoost as the standout performer.
This project not only addresses the pressing need for advanced phishing 
detection mechanisms but also contributes valuable insights into the optimal 
utilization of machine learning techniques in bolstering online security. The 
findings underscore the significance of proactive cybersecurity measures and 
the role of machine learning in mitigating the evolving landscape of cyber 
threats
